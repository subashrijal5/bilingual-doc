# Api and Exports
You need to generate a API Token to access your project strings. TO generate the String you can enter the label and the expiry date. 

You can copy the generated api key. 

import Callout from "../components/Callout"

<Callout>
    Please keep your API token safe to keep your data safe. 
</Callout>

You can generate your token here.

import Image from 'next/image'

<Image
    src="/api-export.png"
    alt="Translate Language"
    width={500}
    height={500}
/>

You can find Api playground and document here.
