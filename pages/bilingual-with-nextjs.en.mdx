# Convert your Next.js Site in multiple language with ease.

## Introduction:

We are going to use [Bilingual](https://bilingual.vuvusha.com) which will assist us to translate our website easily and seamlessly with few commands with the professional and more accurate translation services. Deepl Pro, Google Cloud Translation (Pro) and Bilingual (translation model). 

Bilingual offers beautiful dashboard where you can verify the translated text, SDK’s for different languages and RestAPI so you can easily integrate with any of the frameworks or languages that you prefer. 

## Why bilingual?

Bilingual offers professional versions of all translation with proper accuracy check which result 90% accuracy on the translation. Additionally it helps you to reduce more than 70% of  your cost and effort on development with seamless command line and SDK’s. If you want to hire a human translator as well, bilingual with reduce about 90% of the work of the human translator as his job will be only to review and approve. 

 

## Let’s start.

Today I would like to present how we can integrate bilingual in your next.js (App Router) project. 

At first, Let’s create a next.js project. 

To create a next js project. you can run. 

To install Next.js 14, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

On installation you will see following prompts

```bash
What is your project named? my-app
Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
Would you like to use `src/` directory? No / Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? No / Yes
What import alias would you like configured? @/*
```

You can configure it as per your preference. 

Here is my configuration

![Untitled](/images/Untitled.png)

Now move to the directory of our newly created and  install next-intl and Bilingual-ts package which will help us to integrate our translation easily. To install, Run: 

```bash
cd path/to/your-project-directory
npm install next-intl bilingual-ts 
```

Ok we have successfully installed the packages that are required to initialize the project. 

Let’s open on your favorite code editor. In my case, I am using vs-code, to open I will run 

```bash
code .
```

### Middleware and configuration.

Now, set up the plugin which creates an alias to provide your i18n configuration (specified in the next step) to Server Components.

You can get detailed information here on official documentation of [next-intl](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/) . 

To do, write following code in  `next.config.mjs` . 

```jsx
import createNextIntlPlugin from 'next-intl/plugin';
 
const withNextIntl = createNextIntlPlugin();
 
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {};
 
export default withNextIntl(nextConfig);
```

If you are using common js, `import` statement will not work. Use following configuration.

```jsx
const createNextIntlPlugin = require('next-intl/plugin');
 
const withNextIntl = createNextIntlPlugin();
 
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {};
 
module.exports = withNextIntl(nextConfig);
```

`next-intl` creates a configuration once per request. Here you can provide messages and other options depending on the locale of the user.

Let’s create a `i18n.ts`  file on the root directory. Where we can configure our languages for server and client. 

```jsx
import {notFound} from 'next/navigation';
import {getRequestConfig} from 'next-intl/server';
 
// Can be imported from a shared config
const locales = ['en', 'de'];
 
export default getRequestConfig(async ({locale}) => {
  // Validate that the incoming `locale` parameter is valid
  if (!locales.includes(locale as any)) notFound();
 
  return {
    messages: (await import(`../locales/${locale}.json`)).default
  };
});
```

Now, We need to setup the middleware to handle the locales for the request and redirects or rewrites  acordingly. 

create `middleware.ts` on the root directory of the project and write following code. 

```jsx
import createMiddleware from 'next-intl/middleware';
 
export default createMiddleware({
  // A list of all locales that are supported
  locales: ['en', 'de'],
 
  // Used when no locale matches
  defaultLocale: 'en'
});
 
export const config = {
  // Match only internationalized pathnames
  matcher: ['/', '/(de|en)/:path*']
}
```

If you are not aware of next.js middleware, please check here. [https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware)

## File Based Routing

As well all know, Next.js offers file based routing, so, let’s create `[locale]` directory inside `app`  directory and configure the html language dynamically in `layout.tsx` 

Let’s ,move our existing `layout.tsx`  and `page.tsx`  inside `[locale]` directory. 

Now the directory should look like this. 

```jsx
app/[locale]/layout.tsx
app/[locale]/page.tsx
```

As `Next.js`   supports file based routing, now we can easily get our current locale on the params. Let’s change the `layout.tsx`  a little bit. 

```jsx
export default function LocaleLayout({
  children,
  params: {locale}
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  params: {locale: string};
}) {
  return (
    <html lang={locale}>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

So, we have got the current locale from the param and set the `<html lang={locale}`  so browser can understand the current locale. 

Similarly let’s use the locales in  `page`.tsx as well. 

```jsx
import {useTranslations} from 'next-intl';
 
export default function Index() {
  const t = useTranslations('Index');
  return <h1>{t('title')}</h1>;
}
```

We have completed the initial setup of the `next-intl` , now Let’s set up [Bilingual](https://bilingual.vuvusha.com) to translate your texts automatically, push to translate and get the translated texts. 

To do,  [Sign Up](https://bilingualapp.vuvusha.com/register) in [Bilingual](https://bilingual.vuvusha.com) , purchase the characters you might need or start a free trial. 

After successful trial, you will be redirected to the project page, where you can create a new project. 

![Untitled](/images/Untitled%201.png)

You can create the project by clicking create button on top right corner, you can fill up the form with Project Name (Name of your project), Translation Model( if you are in trial you can only use Bilingual) and the language( The language you want to translate from) and description( it is optional, if you want to have any and submit the form. 

![Untitled](/images/Untitled%202.png)

Once you submit the form you will be redirected to the project page, where you can add your translation language, or click on the base language where you can add the texts that you want to translate. 

![Untitled](/images/Untitled%203.png)

Here you can add language on which you want to translate your texts. And To add the texts, you can click on the base Language, then you will be redirected to the page where you can add the source text, which will be translated and validated with AI engine in the background. 

![Untitled](/images/Untitled%204.png)

Or you can import from the Json, Csv or Excel. To import you can jump to the Import/Export tab on the project page, download the sample to check the supported format.  edit it and upload it to import the texts in bulk. 

![Untitled](/images/Untitled%205.png)

Additionally, you can post the existing json from the codebase with the command line tool. To do that, let’s create the Authentication Key for the project, To create the Authentication code, go to **Api and Exports** tab on the Project page, Generate the Api key, with the name and the expiry Date ( If you leave empty, It will Never expires). Also do not share the key with anyone. 

Once you created the Project Key, You can go back to the code

## Setup Project Key And locales base Directory

As we already have installed javascript library for the bilingual-ts previously. Now we need to set up environment variable to provide Project Key, Locales Base Directory etc. 

Let’s  create a `.env` on our root Directory and Add our environment variables. 

```bash
BILINGUAL_API_KEY=Your APi Key
LOCALE_BASE_PATH="locales"
LANGUAGE_CODE_MAP="en:en-us,jp:ja"
```

Here, you may not understand the `LANGUAGE_CODE_MAP`  key, It is optional. 

Some time supported language code of the Bilingual might be different then the language code of your locale environment, at that time, you can map your language code as shown in example above, where you can map multiple language codes comma separated. 

On example `en:en-us`  `en` (Left side) represents the local directory name or language code and `en-us`  is Bilingual Language code. 

Now finally let’s create a `locales` directory which is our base directory to store the translation data. 

Now., to get the translated languages from bilingual, you can Run, 

```bash
npx get-translated
```

now you can see the files inside the locales folder. 

![Untitled](/images/Untitled%206.png)

Additionally. if You want to push the new files to the server for translation, 

You can change the json files, create new page and add more json, 

The you can run, 

```bash
npx push-locales
```

Which will push your all of the newly added Json. files to the server. 

After few seconds or minutes, your translation and verification process will be completed.,

So you can again run `npx get-translated`  to get the translated languages.

Now, you can seamlessly, add update, push to server and get from the servers with single commands.
